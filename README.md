## Project title
Yummy - A Restaurant Online Reservation and Order System


## Description
Our online web system is aiming to allow diners to make reservations to one specific restaurant and order their food in advance or on site. In addition to the basic reservation and ordering function, we also plan to put some simple games on our website so that users can play with them while waiting for their food. Users can also comment on the dishes they tried and add dishes to their favorite list. For restaurant owners, they can register their restaurant on our website and add, delete and edit their dishes available with pictures for the customers. They can also use it for business analysis from the stats and data visualizations of their selling.
